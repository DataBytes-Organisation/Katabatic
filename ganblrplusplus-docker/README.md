# GANBLR++ Dockerized Implementation Report

## Overview

This report documents the Dockerization of **GANBLR++**, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model developed to generate synthetic tabular data. This implementation ensures that the model can run within a reproducible Docker container, encapsulating all dependencies and environment settings, allowing for seamless execution across various systems. GANBLR++ builds upon the original GANBLR model to improve the generation of high-quality synthetic tabular data.

By packaging GANBLR++ into a Docker container, we achieve:
- **Consistency** across various platforms.
- **Ease of setup** by bundling dependencies.
- **Improved deployment** via Docker for simplified running of the model.

## Features

- **Reproducibility:** The project runs inside a Docker container, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Portability:** The Docker image can be built and deployed on any system supporting Docker.
- **Simplified Setup:** No need to manually install dependencies; Docker handles everything.
- **Customizable:** Easy to modify the code, models, or data inside the container.
- **Flexibility:** GANBLR++ can generate synthetic data for a wide range of tabular datasets.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ganblrplusplus-docker.git
cd ganblrplusplus-docker

2. Build the Docker Image
In the project directory, build the Docker image using the Dockerfile provided:

docker build -t ganblrplusplus:latest .

This will create a Docker image named ganblrplusplus with the latest version of the model and its dependencies.

3. Run the Docker Container
After building the Docker image, you can run the container with the following command:

docker run --name ganblrplusplus-container ganblrplusplus:latest

4. Access the Container
To access the container (for debugging or interaction), run:

docker exec -it ganblrplusplus-container /bin/bash
