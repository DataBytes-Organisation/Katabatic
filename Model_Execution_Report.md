Introduction to the Set-Up
The project leverages Docker and Docker Compose to create a containerized environment for deploying and managing data-generative models via the Katabatic framework. Katabatic is an open-source tool for generating synthetic tabular data and evaluating it using models like GANBLR, TableGAN, and MedGan.

Explanation of Services
Web Service
Acts as a RESTful API for interacting with the Katabatic framework. Runs in a Docker container accessible on port 5000, ensuring consistent interaction with Katabatic.
Database Service (PostgreSQL)
Stores generated or processed data, including synthetic datasets, model configurations, and logs. Running PostgreSQL in its container ensures isolation and consistency, connected to the web service for data storage and retrieval.
Production Deployment and Maintenance of Different Models
The goal is to containerize individual models like GANBLR, TableGAN, and MedGan, providing benefits such as:

Dependency Isolation: Each model has its environment, preventing interference.
Scalability: Docker Compose simplifies scaling services.
Modularity: Containerizing each model creates a modular system for independent development and testing.
Putting Theory into Play at Katabatic
The Docker-based setup allows efficient operation of the Katabatic framework with multiple models. For instance, when generating synthetic healthcare data, both GANBLR and MedGan models are deployed in separate containers. The web service acts as the central point for interacting with these models, with data stored in the PostgreSQL database.

Conclusion
Using Docker and Docker Compose, a scalable and modular environment was created for working with the Katabatic framework and associated models. This setup not only facilitates easy deployment and management of data-generative models like GANBLR but also lays the groundwork for future expansion and integration of additional models. The research findings provide valuable insights into the models' theoretical foundations and practical applications, supporting informed decisions regarding their use in various domains.

Implementation Strategy
Dockerfile Implementation
The Dockerfile for the application is structured with a multilayered approach, chosen to optimize the build process, reduce build times, and maintain a modular architecture.

Dockerfile

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only requirements.txt first to leverage Docker cache
COPY requirements.txt /app/

# Install any necessary dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . /app

# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 5000

# Run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]  # Replace with your actual application entry point


Justification for Multilayered Dockerfile Implementation
Leverage Docker Cache for Efficiency: By copying requirements.txt first and installing dependencies before copying the entire application code, the Dockerfile takes full advantage of Docker’s caching mechanism, significantly reducing build times.

Modularity and Maintainability: Separating dependency installation from the application code enhances modularity and simplifies dependency management.

Reduced Build Times and Resource Efficiency: Only the necessary components are rebuilt when changes are made, reducing build times and resource usage, which is critical in a CI/CD pipeline.

Production-Ready Image: The image is minimal and production-ready, containing only the necessary runtime environment and dependencies, which reduces potential attack vectors and enhances security.

  pgdata:


Explanation of Docker Compose Components
Web Service: This service builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile and runs the application. It is configured to wait for the database service before starting, ensuring the necessary dependencies are in place.
Database Service: The PostgreSQL database service is configured with a persistent volume to ensure data is not lost when the container is stopped or restarted.
Persistent Volumes: Using Docker volumes ensures data persists between container restarts, crucial for maintaining application state and data integrity in a production environment.
Conclusion and Recommendations
The Docker and Docker Compose setup provides a robust, scalable, and modular framework for deploying and managing data-generative models. This approach ensures consistency across environments, simplifies the development and deployment process, and offers a production-ready solution capable of handling complex workflows like those required by the Katabatic framework.

Recommendations:

CI/CD Integration: Implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines would further enhance the deployment process by automating testing and deployment tasks.
Security Enhancements: Regular updates to dependencies and implementing security best practices, such as scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities, would further secure the deployment.
Monitoring and Logging: Integrating monitoring and logging services would provide better insights into application performance and facilitate troubleshooting.
