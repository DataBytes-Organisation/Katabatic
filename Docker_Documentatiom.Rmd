Aiko-Services Docker Setup and Process



Overview

This documentation outlines the Docker setup and process for the Aiko-Services project, which involves multiple machine learning models (GANBLR, GANBLR++, MEG, TableGAN, CTGAN, etc.) running in separate containers. The goal is to create a Docker environment that allows each model to run independently, with a single docker-compose file managing all the containers.




Prerequisites

- Docker installed on the system
- Docker Compose installed on the system
- Aiko-Services project code cloned from the GitHub repository



Step 1: Create a Dockerfile for each model

- Why separate Dockerfiles?
- Creating separate Dockerfiles for each model ensures that each model has its own environment and dependencies, without conflicts or version issues. This approach also makes it easier to maintain and update individual models.



Dockerfile example: GANBLR
Here's an example Dockerfile for the GANBLR model:


# GANBLR Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy model code
COPY ganblr /app/ganblr

# Expose port 8000 for the model
EXPOSE 8000

# Run command to start the model
CMD ["python", "ganblr/main.py"]
Similarly, create separate Dockerfiles for each model, adjusting the dependencies and code copies as needed.




Step 2: Create a Docker image for each model
Using the Dockerfiles created in Step 1, build a Docker image for each model. For example, to build the GANBLR image:

docker build -t ganblr-image -f ganblr/Dockerfile .
This will create a Docker image with the name ganblr-image.




Step 3: Create a docker-compose file
Create a docker-compose file that defines the services for each model and how they should be run. Here's an example
docker-compose file:


version: '3'

services:
  ganblr:
    image: ganblr-image
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db

  ganblr++:
    image: ganblrplusplus-image
    ports:
      - "8001:8001"
    depends_on:
      - db

  meg:
    image: meg-image
    ports:
      - "8002:8002"
    depends_on:
      - db

  tablegan:
    image: tablegan-image
    ports:
      - "8003:8003"
    depends_on:
      - db

  ctgan:
    image: ctgan-image
    ports:
      - "8004:8004"
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=myuser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
This docker-compose file defines five services, one for each model, and a PostgreSQL database service. Each model service uses its corresponding Docker image and exposes a port for access. The depends_on directive ensures that each model service starts only after the database service is up and running.



Step 4: Run the docker-compose file
Finally, to start all the services, run the docker-compose file:

docker-compose up -d
This will start all the services in detached mode. You can then access each model by visiting http://localhost:<port> in your web browser, where <port> is the port number exposed by each model (e.g., 8000 for GANBLR).

Conclusion
This documentation outlines the Docker setup and process for the Aiko-Services project, which involves creating separate Dockerfiles and images for each model, and a docker-compose file to manage all the containers. This approach ensures that each model runs independently, with easy maintenance and updates.
