# CTGAN: Generating Synthetic Tabular Data

Hello everyone! I've been working on implementing CTGAN (Conditional Tabular GAN) as part of the Katabatic framework. CTGAN is a fascinating model designed to generate synthetic tabular data, and I want to share an example of how it works using the classic Iris dataset.

## What is CTGAN?

CTGAN, or Conditional Tabular GAN, is a type of Generative Adversarial Network specifically tailored for tabular data. It's designed to capture the distributions and relationships in your original data and create new, synthetic samples that maintain these characteristics.

## The Iris Dataset Example

To demonstrate CTGAN's capabilities, I've used the well-known Iris dataset. It's a simple but effective dataset with 150 samples, 4 numerical features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width), and 1 categorical target (Iris species).

Here's what happened when I ran CTGAN on this dataset:

### Training Process

I trained the model (ctgan_example.py in ctgan folder) for 10 epochs. Here's a snippet of the training output:

```
Epoch 0, Loss D: 19.4568, Loss G: 1.1630
Epoch 1, Loss D: 18.5340, Loss G: 1.1807
...
Epoch 8, Loss D: 7.3483, Loss G: 0.9190
Epoch 9, Loss D: 6.0030, Loss G: 0.8083
```

You can see the loss for both the Discriminator (D) and Generator (G) decreasing over time, which indicates that both parts of the model are learning.

### Generated Data

After training, CTGAN generated 150 synthetic samples to match the original dataset size. Here's a comparison of some key statistics:

```
Feature: Real Mean (Std) vs Synthetic Mean (Std)
sepal length: 5.8433 (0.8281) vs 4.5374 (0.3615)
sepal width:  3.0573 (0.4359) vs 3.1174 (0.4885)
petal length: 3.7580 (1.7653) vs 3.3229 (1.2725)
petal width:  1.1993 (0.7622) vs 0.6768 (0.5113)

Category Distribution (Real vs Synthetic):
0: 33.33% vs 78.67%
1: 33.33% vs 12.67%
2: 33.33% vs 8.67%
```

## What Can We Learn From This?

1. **Feature Distributions**: CTGAN has captured the general range of the features, but there are differences in the means and standard deviations. This is quite normal for GANs, especially with limited training.

2. **Category Imbalance**: The synthetic data shows a significant imbalance in categories compared to the original balanced distribution. This is an area where our model could use some improvement.

3. **Data Range**: The synthetic data maintains the min-max ranges of the original data for most features, which is a positive aspect.

4. **Variance**: The synthetic data generally shows less variance compared to the original data, particularly for sepal length.

## Room for Improvement

Based on these results, here are some areas we could focus on to improve the model:

1. **Balancing Categories**: We need to work on better preserving the original category distribution. This might involve adjusting the model architecture or loss function.

2. **Preserving Variance**: The model seems to be underestimating the variance in some features. We could experiment with different normalization techniques or model architectures to address this.

3. **Extended Training**: Running the model for more epochs might help it capture the data distributions more accurately.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting parameters like learning rate, batch size, or the structure of the generator and discriminator could lead to better results.

## A Note on Benchmarking

It's important to note that this example is not benchmarked against other methods or implementations. It's meant to provide a basic understanding of how CTGAN works and what kind of output it produces. For a more comprehensive evaluation, we'd need to compare it with other data generation methods and use a wider range of evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion

This CTGAN implementation shows promise in generating synthetic tabular data. While it has some areas for improvement, it demonstrates the potential of using GANs for creating synthetic datasets. As we continue to refine the model, we can expect to see even better results in maintaining the statistical properties of the original data.
