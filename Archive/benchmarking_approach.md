# Benchmarking Tabular Data Generation Models

## 1. Define Benchmarking Objectives

- **Data Fidelity**: How closely does the synthetic data resemble the real data in terms of statistical properties?
- **Utility**: How well can models trained on synthetic data generalize to real data?
- **Privacy**: Does the synthetic data protect against revealing sensitive information from the original dataset?
- **Scalability and Efficiency**: How well does the model handle large datasets and how computationally expensive is it?

## 2. Select Datasets

- **Variety of Datasets**: Use a diverse set of datasets, including different sizes, types (categorical, continuous, mixed), and domains (finance, healthcare, retail).
- **Real-World Datasets**: Choose real-world datasets that represent practical applications.
- **Publicly Available Datasets**: Prefer publicly available datasets to ensure reproducibility.

## 3. Define Evaluation Metrics

### Fidelity Metrics:

- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test**: Compare distributions of continuous features between real and synthetic data.
- **Wasserstein Distance**: Measure the difference between distributions of real and synthetic data.
- **Jaccard Similarity**: For categorical data, evaluate the overlap of categories between real and synthetic data.
- **Correlation Matrix Comparison**: Compare correlation matrices of real and synthetic data to assess inter-feature dependencies.

### Utility Metrics:

- **Train on Synthetic, Test on Real (TSTR)**: Train a model on synthetic data and evaluate its performance on real data.
- **Train on Real, Test on Synthetic (TRTS)**: Train a model on real data and evaluate its performance on synthetic data.
- **Downstream Task Performance**: Evaluate synthetic data by using it for specific tasks like classification, regression, or clustering and comparing the results to those obtained using real data.

### Privacy Metrics:

- **Membership Inference Attack (MIA)**: Measure the risk of inferring whether a specific record was part of the real dataset.
- **Differential Privacy (DP) Guarantees**: If applicable, evaluate whether the model provides differential privacy guarantees.
- **Attribute Inference Attack**: Assess the risk of predicting sensitive attributes of real data from synthetic data.

### Scalability and Efficiency Metrics:

- **Training Time**: Measure the time it takes to train the model on different datasets.
- **Memory Usage**: Evaluate the memory consumption during model training.
- **Generation Speed**: Assess how quickly the model can generate synthetic data.

## 4. Design a Benchmarking Framework

- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Ensure a consistent preprocessing pipeline for all datasets, including handling missing values, scaling, and encoding.
- **Model Implementation**: Implement each tabular data generation model in a consistent framework (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch) to ensure comparability.
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure all experiments are reproducible by setting random seeds and documenting the environment (e.g., Python version, library versions).

## 5. Run Benchmarking Experiments

- **Baseline Models**: Include simple models (e.g., Gaussian Noise, Random Sampling) as baselines for comparison.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to evaluate models on multiple splits of the data.
- **Statistical Significance**: Test the statistical significance of differences in performance between models.

## 6. Analyze and Visualize Results

- **Aggregate Results**: Summarize the results across datasets and models to identify trends and outliers.
- **Visualization**: Use visualizations like box plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to compare model performance across metrics.
- **Report Findings**: Document the strengths and weaknesses of each model, highlighting where certain models excel or underperform.
