                    <h1>About Katabatic</h1>
                    <p>
                        Katabatic is an innovative open-source project spearheaded by Dr. Nayyar Zaidi and Mr. Jaime Blackwell, under the leadership of DataBytes, a cutting-edge firm specializing in AI and data science solutions. This project addresses a critical gap in the development and integration of tabular data generation algorithms, bringing together diverse methods in a seamless and unified platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), high-quality data is essential for training robust models. However, the development of tabular data, which is integral to many machine learning tasks, remains a fragmented and complex process. Traditional data generation techniques often operate in silos, requiring different skill sets and workflows. To tackle this challenge, Katabatic aims to simplify and streamline the creation of synthetic tabular data by integrating existing algorithms, thus making it easier for researchers, data scientists, and AI practitioners to access, compare, and evaluate various methods in one unified environment.
